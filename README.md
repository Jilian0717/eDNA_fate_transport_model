Codes related to the eDNA fate and transport model developed for the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in Hood Canal, WA. The model was built using ROMS and the particle tracking package [Tracker 2](https://github.com/parkermac/LO/tree/main/tracker2).

The large particle trajectory files can be found in https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13629604 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13628658.
